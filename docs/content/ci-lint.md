## Lint

In order to ensure some standard of quality, a lint action is being run
that checks for syntax issues, yaml issues and validates github actions
in the repository. It's not complete or fully accurate by any measure,
but it enforces conventions for the work being added in PRs.

It's generally incomplete, but extensions are welcome.

To invoke the linter locally, use `task lint`.

Adoption: Internal use for PR workflows on the repository.
